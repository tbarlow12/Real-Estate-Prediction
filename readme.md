# Final Report
- Please see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UulBoQ06vrm9qZGzgNj8u7pfuXx8uPkc-l6lh_imKdc/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed description of our project

# To Run
- For TAs, using CADE Lab machines, use the command `sh run.sh`
- Anyone running Python 3.6, use the command `python eval.py`
- This will not run a full evaluation, as the section for finding the best features is currently commented out. It will also not run any of our feature extraction or data cleanup code, which is located in the 'data_collection' directory
