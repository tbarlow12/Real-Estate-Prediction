# Working models:
- Stochastic gradient descent

# Things to do:
- Transform year and date features into one continuous feature
    - M = year * 12 + month
- Combine data files for more informative datasets
    - E.g. Combine 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, 3 bedroom, etc. files into one file with the number of bedrooms as a feature
- Stochastic gradient descent
    - Run cross validation with different hyper params (learning rate and epochs) to see which gives us the best results 

# Progress
- 11/8/17
    - Stochastic gradient descent implemented
    - RMSE metric for evaluation implmented
    - K fold cross validation implemented
    - Non-normalized RMSE of 2806.345 with SGD on sample data... Not sure if that's good or bad, but we got something working and evaluated

# Plans
- Pass ML
- Graduate
- Start sweet company
