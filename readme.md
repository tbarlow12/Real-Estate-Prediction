#Working models:
- Stochastic gradient descent

#Things to do:
- Transform year and date features into one continuous feature
    - M = year * 12 + month
- Stochastic gradient descent
    - Run cross validation with different hyper params (learning rate and epochs) to see which gives us the best results 

#Progress
- 11/8/17 - Non-normalized RMSE of 2806.345 with SGD... Not sure if that's good or bad, but we got something working and evaluated

#Plans
- Pass ML
- Graduate
- Start sweet company
